# End-to-End-Analysis-of-TMDb-Data
This project is a classic example of a full-stack project because it encompasses data acquisition from an API, data processing and storage using a database (SQLite), and presenting the data through a Flask web application. This includes both backend (data handling, database management) and frontend (Flask serves HTML/CSS/JS) components.
