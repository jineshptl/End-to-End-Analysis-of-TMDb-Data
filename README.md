# End-to-End-Analysis-of-TMDb-Data
This project is a classic example of a full-stack project because it encompasses data acquisition from an API, data processing and storage using a database (SQLite), and presenting the data through a Flask web application. This includes both backend (data handling, database management) and frontend (Flask serves HTML/CSS/JS) components.

# HW1: End-to-End Analysis of TMDb Data

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end process of collecting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data from The Movie Database (TMDb). It highlights the use of APIs, SQLite for data storage, and Flask for web application development to visualize data.

## Objectives
- Collect data from TMDb via API.
- Store and manage data using SQLite.
- Develop a Flask web application to visualize the data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
- TMDb API

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Automated data collection from TMDb API.
- **Data Management**: Utilization of SQLite for efficient data storage and management.
- **Data Visualization**: Development of a Flask web application to present the data interactively.

## Setup and Running
1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Install Python 3.x.
    - Install necessary packages: `pip install flask sqlite requests`.

2. **Database Setup**:
    - Run `python setup_database.py` to set up the SQLite database and tables.

3. **Running the Flask App**:
    - Navigate to the app directory: `cd flask_app`.
    - Run the application: `python app.py`.
    - Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Data
The data involves movie details fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb), which includes movie titles, genres, ratings, and cast information.
